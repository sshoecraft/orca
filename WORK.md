# WORK: Orca Job Orchestrator Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-17
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Build a job orchestrator called "orca" with a web-based user interface that can execute commands on remote systems. The system must support both Windows and Linux systems, use PostgreSQL as the backend database, and NOT use Docker. Success criteria includes registering two test systems and executing the `whoami` command on both.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- **Symptom**: Need for centralized job orchestration across heterogeneous systems
- **Root Cause**: No unified platform exists to manage and execute commands across both Windows and Linux systems
- **Evidence**: Manual command execution requires individual system access and lacks audit trails
- **Affected Systems**:
  - Components: Web UI, API Backend, Job Engine, Database
  - Services: SSH (Linux), WinRM (Windows) 
  - Database: PostgreSQL schema for systems, jobs, executions

## 📚 Required Documentation
### Primary Documentation (Read First)
- **System Design**: `DESIGN.md` - Complete architecture and implementation guide
- **Test Systems**: `TESTUSER.md` - Credentials and connection details for test systems
- **Implementation Patterns**: `EXECUTER.md` - Code patterns and standards to follow

### Supporting Documentation
- **Testing Strategy**: `TESTER.md` - Comprehensive testing approach
- **Documentation Standards**: `DOCUMENTER.md` - Pattern capture methodology
- **Quality Assurance**: `VERIFIER.md` - Code quality standards

### Code References
- **Windows Test Script**: Lines 27-49 in TESTUSER.md - WinRM connection pattern
- **Linux Test Script**: Lines 54-101 in TESTUSER.md - SSH connection pattern

## 🛠 Solution Design
- **Strategy**: Build modular system with clear separation of concerns
- **Patterns to Apply**: 
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Service layer for business logic
  - Async/await for concurrent operations
  - Factory pattern for connection management
- **Database Changes**: Create schema as defined in DESIGN.md
- **Validation Approach**: Test connections to both systems, verify command execution
- **Potential Risks**: 
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Authentication failures
  - Concurrent execution conflicts

## ⚠️ Common Violations to Prevent
- **Type Safety**: No 'any' types in TypeScript code
- **Error Handling**: All exceptions must be caught and logged
- **Security**: Never log passwords or sensitive data
- **Code Quality**: Follow PEP 8 for Python, ESLint rules for TypeScript
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage
